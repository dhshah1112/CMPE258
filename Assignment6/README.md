# CMPE258 Assignment 6: Advanced Machine Learning Techniques with TensorFlow and Keras

## Overview
This repository contains the assignments and resources for Assignment 6, focusing on advanced machine learning techniques using TensorFlow and Keras. The assignment is divided into two main parts:

- Part 01: Demonstrates various data augmentation and generalization techniques in TensorFlow.
- Part 02: Utilizes advanced deep learning constructs and concepts in Keras.
  
## Assignment Description

### Part 01: Data Augmentation and Generalization Techniques
This part includes several Colab notebooks that illustrate different data augmentation and generalization techniques such as L1/L2 regularization, dropout methods, and custom callbacks. The aim is to conduct A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of these techniques.

Techniques covered:

- L1, L2 regularization
- Dropout, Monte Carlo Dropout
- Early stopping
- Various initializations
- Batch normalization
- Custom dropout and regularization
- Usage of callbacks and TensorBoard
- Keras Tuner for hyperparameter optimization
- Keras CV data augmentation
- Image classification with data augmentation
- Exploring FastAI's data augmentation capabilities

### Part 02: Advanced Keras Deep Learning Constructs
This section dives deeper into the Keras library to explore and implement advanced features like custom layers, custom loss functions, and custom training loops.

Features demonstrated:

- Custom learning rate schedulers
- Custom dropout (MCAlphaDropout)
- Custom normalization (MaxNormDense)
- Integration with TensorBoard
- Custom loss, activation functions, regularizers, and constraints
- Custom metrics, layers, and models
- Custom optimizer and training loops
