# Short Story Assignment : Summary of a research (survey) paper

## Overview
This assignment involved summarizing a research paper titled "Beyond Accuracy: Evaluating the Reasoning Behavior of Large Language Models - A Survey," which examines whether recent Large Language Models (LLMs) can mimic human reasoning and thinking processes. The project was divided into four key deliverables: a summary paper, a Medium article, a PowerPoint presentation (PPT), and a video presentation.

## Deliverables

### Summary Paper
The task was to condense the survey paper into a succinct summary using original language, complemented by a personal analysis of the findings. This summary was intended to capture the essence of the research while reflecting a deep understanding of the material. The paper I wrote is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oPMF9OP4V2DZJ4aavcWNu2lZSXXmOoFN/view?usp=drive_link)

### Medium Article
The objective here was to craft an engaging and informative article suitable for publication on Medium. The article, titled ["Unveiling the Thought Process of AI: A Deep Dive into the Reasoning of Large Language Models"](https://medium.com/@dhshah1112/unveiling-the-thought-process-of-ai-a-deep-dive-into-the-reasoning-of-large-language-models-b0472a6ec44e) focuses on the architecture, ablation studies, and metrics of LLMs. It integrates visuals from the original paper and avoids complex technical jargon and mathematics, making it accessible to a broader audience.

### PowerPoint Presentation
The presentation required a detailed overview of the paper's findings in a visually engaging format. It was crafted to represent a comprehensive understanding of the content, structured to guide viewers through the key points discussed in the survey. The PPT is available [here](https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/dhruvalshahcmpe258shortstorypptpptx/267570651).

### Video Presentation
This component involved creating a video that explains the topic in detail, using the PowerPoint slides as a visual aid. The video, intended to last between 15-25 minutes, serves as an explanatory session, aiming to elucidate the paper's findings and the presenter's understanding of them. The video can be viewed [here](https://youtu.be/4G8TpmxEo90?si=G_4XKewSwvoe2Zay).
