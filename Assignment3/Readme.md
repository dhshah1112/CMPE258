A) Use fast AI for  writing a detailed colab (no copy paste from hints) - which show training and inference of below tasks using fast.ai - showcase results metrics 

vision object detection task
vision segmentation task
tabular task
recommendation task

Hint:  https://github.com/fastai/fastbook/blob/master/01_intro.ipynbLinks to an external site. Use other data sets and not the ones in colab.
B) Use for various tasks with hugginface transformers api 
for following tasks

Text classification
Named entity recognition
Question answering
Text summarization
Translation
Zero-shot classification

Computer vision
Audio
Table QA

C) User Keras-NLP for various nlp tasks

Inference with a pretrained classifier
Fine tuning a pretrained backbone
Fine tuning with user-controlled preprocessing
Fine tuning a custom modes  

Do not copy paste - use this for inspiration only

D) User Keras-CV for various vision tasks
Object detection using YOLO model

Inference with a pretrained classifier
Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone
Training a image classifier from scratch
train custom object detection model
