A) Use fast AI for  writing a detailed colab (no copy paste from hints) - which show training and inference of below tasks using fast.ai - showcase results metrics 
For this part I have completed the below 4 tasks.  
-vision object detection task
-vision segmentation task
-tabular task
-recommendation task

Datasets used : 
1. Yoga Pose Detection
2. BSDS Dataset
3. Titanic Dataset
4. MovieLens 100k Dataset

B) I have performed below various tasks with hugginface transformers api : 

Text classification : Sentiment Analysis 
Named entity recognition : Provided a text input this outputs a list of famous Location,  Personalities, Organization.
Question answering : A basic QA interface
Text summarization : Provided a large enough text, outputs a summary of it 
Translation : Provided a text in one language, outputs a translated text in second language
Zero-shot classification : Model can correctly predict labels or categories that it has never seen before during training

I have applied different techniques to resolve the following 
Computer vision : Uploaded a photo of Lion and asked the model to perform Object Classification using fasterrcnn_resnet50_fpn and COCO classes. 
Audio : Uploaded an audio asked to retrieve the text from it. 
Table QA : Uploaded and trained the model on Iris dataset and then built a QA interface for question answering.

C) Used Keras-NLP for various nlp tasks

1. Inference with a pretrained classifier
2. Fine tuning a pretrained backbone
3. Fine tuning with user-controlled preprocessing
4. Fine tuning a custom modes

D) Used Keras-CV for various vision tasks
Object detection using YOLO model : 

1. Inference with a pretrained classifier
2. Fine-tuning a pretrained backbone 
3. Training a image classifier from scratch
4. Train custom object detection model
