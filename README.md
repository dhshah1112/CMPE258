# CMPE258 Assignments

# Assignment 1 : 
 This assignment's outcome is learning how Google's Teachable Machine can create create image, pose and audio classsification models without any code, basically No Code ML. However, we can find basic definitions and even finetune the hyperparameters such as epochs, learning rate and batch size. 
For Image classification I used fruit classification dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karimabdulnabi/fruit-classification10-class
For audio classification I recorded background noise, mine and one more person's voice using the system's mic and trained the model using these 3 sounds. 
For pose classification I recorded 3 poses via the system's webcam and created 3 classes and later tested the model. 
I also created one more pose classification model just for testing purposes by using various yoga positions. Dataset for it can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niharika41298/yoga-poses-dataset
