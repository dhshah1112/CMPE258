# Assignment 07 - Computer Vision
## Assignment Description

### Part 01: Supervised Contrastive Learning
In this part, the assignment involves demonstrating the application of supervised contrastive learning loss for classification tasks compared to the traditional softmax-based approach. The Google Colab notebook includes necessary visualizations to compare these methodologies effectively.

### Part 02: Transfer Learning on Various Modalities
This section requires the creation of simple Google Colab notebooks to demonstrate transfer learning on different modalities including images, videos, and audios. Each modality should be explored both as a feature extractor and for fine-tuning purposes.

Example Task: Implement basic transfer learning for a classification task (e.g., classifying cats/dogs or dog breeds).

### Part 03: Zero-Shot Transfer Learning
The focus here is on showcasing zero-shot transfer learning using the CLIP model and traditional transfer learning using state-of-the-art models from TensorFlow Hub (e.g., BigTransfer).
