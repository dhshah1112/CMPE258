The assignment asked us to submit two colabs : 

A.) Write an agent from scratch using tools in python : 
For part A  I created a text summarization AI Agent bot of text summarization. I used that bot to summarize two texts : First one is giving input a basic textual paragraph and second text thast I gave as input was a complex text gathered from wikipedia about Sachin Tendulkar.
I manually verified the summary generated by the agent and looked pretty cool to me!

B.) Write demonstrations of various agent types with langchain as colab : 
There are four types of langchain bots that are used to create AI Agents : 

1. Zero Shot React Agent: Utilizes pre-trained language models to generate responses to unseen tasks without specific training.

2. Conversational React Agent: Maintains conversational context for more natural, sustained dialogue with users.


3. React Docstore Agent: Searches a document database to provide informed responses based on stored information.



4. Self Ask with Search Agent: Performs autonomous searches to gather and use external information for answering queries.

I demonstrated the working and explaination of all the four bots (AI Agents) in the colab.

I have created a small video demonstrating the working and explaining both of the colabs that I created for this assignment.
