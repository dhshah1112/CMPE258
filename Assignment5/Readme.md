this is the readme file for CMPE258 Assignment5 
Assignment description : 

A) Write  a colab  numpy only from scratch 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression . Use proper non linear activation functions and proper number of hidden layer neurons - show the results / loss and epochs training and final output . You will be doing manual backprop and chain rule based gradient propagation 

B) Write a colab pytorch from scratch - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression withotu using pytorch builtin layer functionality 

C) Write  a colab pytorch classes based - 3 layer deep neural network for non linear regression using pytorch builtin functionality of modules etc.,. backprop etc.,.

D) Write  a colab  pytorch lightening version of the same

E) 
1.Build the same using Tensorflow various variants low level, api, functional, model, builtin 
2.Write  a colab  tensorflow only from scratch not using high level api  of the same
3.Write a colab tensorflow only with builtin layers of the same
4.Write a colab with Use functional api high level api  of tensorflow for the same
5.Write a colab with tensorflow only but using high level api


H) Repeat the above using JAX

Common Instructions for generating all the colabs was to maintain the following things : 

-You must create a 3 layer neural network.

-You must use einsum.

-Use 3 variables based on non-linear equation.

-Generate syntetic data using the equation you used and plot using 4-d plot in matplotlib.
